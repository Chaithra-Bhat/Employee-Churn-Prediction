# Employee-Churn-Prediction
Prediction of employee churn with secure login

* Employee churn is the overall turnover in an organization's staff as existing employees leave and new ones are hired. The churn rate is usually calculated as the percentage of employees leaving the company over some specified time period.
* In this project, the aim is to overcome problems by predicting whether an employee will leave the job or not depending on a series of questions answered by them. These answers are fed as input to the machine learning model which will then predict the most probable decision.
* Seamless integration of a simple yet effective user interface (front end) and a good accuracy logistic regression model using Flask.
* Display and exploratory data analysis was performed on the dataset to get further meaningful insights.
* Some of the well-known techniques of data classification namely, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest was implemented.
* In view of information cybersecurity, a secure website was built using SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit), one of the most secure ways to protect digital information.
* The dataset used was the HRM dataset distributed by IBM Analytics. This dataset contains 35 features relating to 1500 observations and refers to U.S. data. All features are related to
the employeesâ€™ working life and personal characteristics.
